## A Brief History of Velora

Velora's journey began with Mikko, a passionate front-end developer who wholeheartedly believed in the potential of Bulma. Mikko had been a dedicated user of Materialize until 2020 when he noticed the Materialize community was declining. Eager to find a new and promising framework, Mikko discovered Bulma and instantly fell in love with its well-structured and semantic class names, which made it easy to create clean and organized HTML.

As Mikko continued to push the boundaries of web development with Bulma, he came across Tailwind CSS in 2022. Tailwind CSS offered unparalleled flexibility with its utility-first approach, allowing developers to quickly build custom designs without writing custom CSS. This groundbreaking approach piqued Mikko's interest and sparked a burning desire to combine the strengths of both frameworks into one cohesive solution.

Despite their individual strengths, Mikko noticed that using both frameworks together often resulted in conflicts and inconsistencies. Determined to create a unified solution that would bring the best of both worlds while minimizing conflicts and maximizing productivity, Mikko embarked on an exciting and ambitious journey to create Velora.

With unwavering dedication and meticulous attention to detail, Mikko handpicked and integrated the most useful and complementary features from Bulma and Tailwind CSS. Potential conflicts were carefully addressed, and the resulting framework was fine-tuned to ensure a smooth and efficient developer experience.

Through Mikko's vision, perseverance, and relentless pursuit of excellence, Velora was born: a versatile, customizable, and easy-to-use framework that can take your web development projects to new heights. Velora is a shining testament to Mikko's passion for innovation and his commitment to sharing his inspiration and work with the world.
